STEPS:

    1. IÂ²C Communication in Plain C:
       
       i2c_tmp102.c 


    2. Wrap in a C++ Class:

       tmp102.cpp 


    3. Ring Buffer Logic (without hardware):

       ring_buff.cpp 


    4. FreeRTOS / Timer Integration:

        task.cpp


    5. UART Output (Raw and Average):

        uart_out.cpp


    6. Testing Strategy (Prompt Suggestions)

        test.cpp


SUMMARY:

    - Isolate hardware-dependent parts.
    - Make the logic testable without needing actual devices.
    - Allow mocking and test coverage in CI.
